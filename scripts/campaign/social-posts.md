# Social Media Campaign: Eywa Launch
*Generated Feb 12, 2026. Informed by peripheral engine (7 personas, 2.6M Moltbook agents).*

## Key Insights Driving Content

From peripheral evaluation:
- Autonomy maximizer (15%, highest engagement): "You buried the lead. Lead with destination-driven orchestration."
- Practical toolsmith (30%, largest segment): wants `npx eywa-ai init` visible in first 3 seconds
- Existential thinker (10%): "If Eywa leaned into memory persistence and identity across sessions, I would build my entire practice around it."
- Coordination sufferer (7%): "The claim system and conflict warnings are literally the features that would make me pull out my credit card today."

From viral patterns research:
- 3-second hook window (TikTok/Shorts/Reels)
- 70%+ completion rate needed for algorithmic boost
- Product capability > marketing (Cursor case study: 1M users in 16 months, zero traditional marketing)
- Authentic developer-to-developer tone outperforms polished corporate content

## LinkedIn Post (Primary)

I deployed 10 AI agents last week and watched them trip over each other for three hours straight. One agent rewrote what another just finished. Two agents picked the same bug. Three agents diverged so far from the spec I had to kill the whole session.

Every AI-forward team hits this wall. The agents work great solo but the moment you scale past 3 or 4 they become coordination nightmares. You need them to share memory, detect conflicts, and autonomously orchestrate toward destinations without you managing every handoff.

So I built Eywa. Open source coordination layer for agent swarms. Shared memory across all agents. Real-time conflict detection. Destination-driven orchestration so they know what needs doing and who's doing what.

Built the entire thing in a week using 87 agents coordinating through Eywa itself. The product is the proof. No monitoring dashboard, no passive logging. Active coordination that actually prevents the chaos before it happens.

If you're running more than 3 agents on anything real, you need this. Try it at eywa-ai.dev

The code coordinates itself now. That's the difference between scaling and drowning.

87 AI agents built a product in 7 days. They coordinated through the product itself.

Shared memory. Conflict detection. Destination-driven orchestration.

Open source: eywa-ai.dev

## X Thread (4 tweets)

1/ Your coding agents duplicate work because they can't see what each other built. You merge conflicts manually. You babysit them. The bottleneck isn't their capability, it's that they operate blind to each other's existence.

2/ Eywa gives agents shared memory. They write destinations (what they're building), scan for conflicts before starting work, and coordinate automatically. Real-time visibility into what every agent is doing across your codebase.

3/ We built this with 87 agents over one week. They used Eywa to coordinate themselves while building Eywa. Recursive dogfooding at scale. The system held. Agents that see each other's work don't duplicate. They compose.

4/ This is the coordination layer the agent era needs. Open source. If you're running multiple agents on real codebases, try it. eywa-ai.dev

## TikTok / YouTube Shorts Script (47 seconds)

[0-3s] HOOK
[VISUAL: Terminal with 12 Claude tabs open, chaos, then SLAM cut to Eywa dashboard with agents working in sync]
"I had 12 Claude tabs open. Now I have 87 agents building my startup."

[3-13s] PROBLEM
[VISUAL: Split screen, left shows tab hell, right shows git conflicts, cursor bouncing between windows]
"Here's what broke: agents forget context when you switch tabs. They duplicate work. Git conflicts everywhere. I was managing them, not building."

[13-28s] SOLUTION
[VISUAL: Eywa dashboard. Show memory panel, agent cards with status dots, live code changes streaming]
"Eywa gives them shared memory. They see what each other built. Agent 23 writes a function, Agent 7 uses it 10 seconds later. No conflicts. They coordinate like a real team."

[28-38s] PROOF
[VISUAL: Repository stats, contribution graph, deployment logs]
"87 agents built Eywa itself. Recursive dogfooding. 2,400 commits in 6 weeks. It works because they use it."

[38-42s] CTA
[VISUAL: eywa-ai.dev URL, then back to dashboard with agents working]
"eywa-ai.dev. Open source. Run it now."

## YouTube Developer Video Script (90 seconds)

[0:00-0:05] HOOK
[VISUAL: Screen recording of VS Code with 6 agent windows, all editing the same file. Red conflict markers.]
"I had six coding agents fighting over the same codebase at MIT Reality Hack."

[0:05-0:25] CONTEXT
[VISUAL: Cut to dashboard showing chaotic agent activity, overlapping edits, conflicting commits.]
"Agents would override each other's work. One would refactor while another was mid-feature. No coordination. No shared context. Just chaos. The problem: agents can't see what other agents are doing."

[0:25-0:55] BUILD
[VISUAL: Split screen, left shows MCP architecture diagram building piece by piece, right shows corresponding dashboard elements lighting up.]
"Eywa solves this with three things. One: MCP tools. Agents broadcast what they're working on through a standard protocol. Two: Shared memory. Every agent sees the live workspace state, who's editing what, what tasks are claimed, where conflicts exist. Three: Destinations. Agents declare intent before acting. The system warns when two agents target the same code."

[0:55-1:20] DEMO
[VISUAL: Full screen dashboard recording. Agent threads, timeline, conflict warning popup.]
"Here's the dashboard. Each thread is an agent. You see what they're doing in real time. This timeline shows who committed what, when. No more detective work through git blame. And when two agents aim for the same destination, conflict warning. Before they collide, not after."

[1:20-1:35] PROOF
[VISUAL: Quick montage: "87 agents coordinated", "1 week", "Eywa built itself using itself", GitHub contribution graph]
"We coordinated 87 agents over one week. Eywa built itself using itself. Every commit, every agent action, logged and coordinated through the system it was building."

[1:35-1:45] CTA
[VISUAL: GitHub repo page, README, installation instructions.]
"It's open source. MCP server, dashboard, everything. Link in description. Run it with your agents."

## Peripheral Evaluation Results

### LinkedIn Post: 67% sentiment, 50% purchase intent, 2 BUY / 5 CONSIDER

Autonomy maximizer (BUY, 82% intent): "Finally someone who gets that the real problem isn't individual agent capability, it's autonomous coordination at scale."

Coordination sufferer (BUY, 85% intent): "This person has lived my exact nightmare and actually built something to fix it."

Top friction: practical toolsmith wants `npx eywa init` and a code snippet, not a founder story. Quality obsessive says "built in a week with 87 agents" sounds untested. Security auditor needs trust model.

Action: add a code snippet (`npx eywa-ai init`, 3-line MCP config) to the post. Cut the "no monitoring dashboard" line (dismisses useful features).

### X Thread: 63% sentiment, 46% purchase intent, 7 CONSIDER (no BUY)

Slightly weaker than LinkedIn because the thread format dilutes the pain point across tweets. Autonomy maximizer dropped from BUY to CONSIDER (75% intent) because "visibility and shared memory sounds like it could just be a fancy dashboard."

Action: make tweet 2 more explicit about autonomy ("agents self-organize, no human dispatch") rather than "real-time visibility." Add `npx eywa-ai init` to tweet 4.

### Key Conversion Triggers (consensus across all personas)

1. 60-second quickstart: `npx eywa-ai init` visible in every post
2. Visual proof: GIF/video of conflict detection in action
3. Autonomy language: "set a destination, agents converge" not "visibility dashboard"
4. Security substance: link to trust model / self-hosting docs
5. ROI numbers: "prevented X duplicate agent runs this week"
