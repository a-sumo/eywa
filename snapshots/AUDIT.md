### 2. MCP Worker (Cloudflare Workers)
- **Submission commit**: `f1de6dd` (within eywa repo, worker/ directory)
- **Live endpoint**: https://eywa-mcp.armandsumo.workers.dev
- **45 MCP tools**: All present at commit 060a6dc in worker/src/tools/
- **Git verification**: `git show f1de6dd -- worker/`
- **Status**: VERIFIED via git history. Cloudflare deployment history only goes back to Feb 14 (redeployed since submission).

### 3. Guild Navigator (Spatial Mapping Engine)
- **Repo**: /Users/armand/Documents/guild-navigator (private)
- **Submission commit**: `1f0f58f` ("add field of merit vision doc, improved trajectory analysis")
- **Live endpoint**: https://impartial-vitality-production.up.railway.app
- **Deployed on**: Railway
- **API endpoints verified**: /api/rooms, /api/rooms/{id}/map, /api/rooms/{id}/stream, /test/output-ctf.json
- **Demo room**: 39 nodes, 34 trajectories, 17 alignments, 4 agents
- **CTF benchmark**: 36 nodes, 34 trajectories, 17 alignments, 3 agents (expert, methodical-ai, struggling-ai)
- **Status**: VERIFIED via git history and live API

### 4. npm Package (eywa-ai)
- **Registry**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eywa-ai
- **Version at submission**: 0.3.1 (published Feb 10, 2026 at 13:43:03 UTC)
- **Version history** (all pre-deadline):
  - 0.1.0: Feb 6, 2026 13:48 UTC
  - 0.1.1: Feb 6, 2026 14:24 UTC
  - 0.1.2: Feb 6, 2026 19:05 UTC
  - 0.3.0: Feb 10, 2026 09:54 UTC
  - 0.3.1: Feb 10, 2026 13:43 UTC
- **Status**: VERIFIED via npm registry timestamps (immutable, third-party)

### 5. Supabase Database (PostgreSQL + Realtime)
- **Host**: beknjtxysmznenkotjvv.snapcloud.dev
- **Tables**: folds, memories, messages, links, global_insights
- **Status**: PARTIALLY VERIFIED. Schema migrations are in git. Live data was modified post-submission (migration 005 renamed rooms to folds and cleaned stale data).

## Data Snapshots

### Demo fold (hackathon-feb10.json, 17KB)
- **17 memories, 6 messages, 0 links, 0 insights**
- **Timestamps**: Feb 13-14, 2026 (post-submission)
- **Agents**: marcus/claude-code, priya/cursor, james/windsurf, autonomous/bold-hawk
- **Note**: This is SYNTHETIC demo data generated by the `clone_demo_fold` function. The original demo data from the submission was deleted during the rooms-to-folds migration. The data structure and content types are authentic to the application's format, but the specific records were regenerated.

### Eywa-dev fold (eywa-dev-feb14.json, 555KB)
- **586 memories, 0 messages, 0 links, 0 insights**
- **Timestamps**: Feb 12-14, 2026
- **This IS real agent coordination data** from actual development sessions (agents building Eywa itself). Not from the submission deadline, but genuine proof of the coordination system working in production.
- **Breakdown by date**:
  - Feb 12: 517 memories (bulk of autonomous agent work)
  - Feb 13: 3 memories
  - Feb 14: 66 memories

### Guild Navigator - Demo room (navigator-demo-feb14.json)
- **39 nodes, 34 trajectories, 17 alignments**
- **4 agents**: autonomous/bold-hawk, marcus/claude-code, james/windsurf, priya/cursor
- **2 regions**: "REGION 0", "LAUNCH-READY PRODUCT"

### Guild Navigator - CTF benchmark (navigator-ctf-feb14.json)
- **36 nodes, 34 trajectories, 17 alignments**
- **3 agents**: expert, methodical-ai, struggling-ai
- **Hash collision problem-solving scenario**

## What Is Independently Verifiable

| Component | Verification Method | Immutable? |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Web frontend code | Git commit 060a6dc with timestamps | Yes |
| Worker code | Git commit f1de6dd with timestamps | Yes |
| Guild Navigator code | Git commit 1f0f58f with timestamps | Yes |
| npm package | npm registry (0.3.1, Feb 10 13:43 UTC) | Yes (third-party) |
| GitHub repo | Public at github.com/a-sumo/eywa | Yes |
| Demo fold data | Regenerated post-submission | No |
| Eywa-dev data | Real but post-submission (Feb 12+) | Yes (genuine) |
| Navigator spatial data | Live API, matches demo fold | Yes |

## Honest Assessment

The **code** across all components is verifiable through git commit history with timestamps. The **npm package** provides independent third-party verification via the npm registry.

The **demo data** shown in the frozen deployment was regenerated after the submission because a database migration (rooms to folds rename) deleted the original records. The data format and agent interaction patterns are authentic to how the system works, but the specific demo records are not the originals from Feb 10.

The **eywa-dev fold** contains 586 genuine agent memories from Feb 12-14 where autonomous agents were building and maintaining Eywa itself. This is the strongest proof of the system working as described.
