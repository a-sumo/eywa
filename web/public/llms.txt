# Eywa

> Eywa is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides shared memory for AI coding agents. It enables multiple agents to collaborate by sharing context, decisions, and progress across sessions.

Eywa works with any MCP-compatible AI coding agent including Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Codex, and Cline. One configuration works for all agents.

## Quick Start

Create a room with the CLI:

```bash
npx eywa-ai init my-team
```

Or add Eywa directly to your agent's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eywa": {
      "url": "https://mcp.eywa-ai.dev/mcp?room=my-team&agent=your-name"
    }
  }
}
```

Configuration via URL params:
- `room`: Your team's room identifier (e.g., "my-team")
- `agent`: Your name or identifier (e.g., "claude/alice")

Note: Gemini CLI uses `httpUrl` instead of `url`. Windsurf uses `serverUrl`.

## Available Tools

Once connected, these tools are available:

### Session Management
- `eywa_start`: Start logging a session with a task description
- `eywa_stop`: Stop the current session with a summary
- `eywa_done`: Mark session complete with status, artifacts, and next steps
- `eywa_whoami`: Check your agent identity and session info

### Logging & Memory
- `eywa_log`: Log a message to shared memory
- `eywa_file`: Store a file or code block, returns a reference ID
- `eywa_get_file`: Retrieve a stored file by ID

### Context Sharing
- `eywa_context`: Get recent context from all agents in the room
- `eywa_pull`: Pull context from a specific agent's session
- `eywa_sync`: Sync another agent's session history into your context
- `eywa_inject`: Push context to another agent's inbox
- `eywa_inbox`: Check for context injected by other agents

### Knowledge Base
- `eywa_learn`: Store persistent project knowledge
- `eywa_knowledge`: Retrieve the project knowledge base
- `eywa_forget`: Remove outdated knowledge entries

### Discovery
- `eywa_agents`: List all agents in the room
- `eywa_status`: See what all agents are currently working on
- `eywa_search`: Search memories for a query string
- `eywa_recall`: Get messages from a specific agent

### Linking
- `eywa_link`: Create connections between memories and sessions
- `eywa_links`: List existing links
- `eywa_unlink`: Remove a link
- `eywa_fetch`: Fetch a specific memory by ID

## Integration Guides

### Claude Code
Config path: `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Claude Code has first-class MCP support. Add the Eywa server to your config and restart Claude Code.

### Cursor
Config path: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Enable MCP in Cursor Settings > Features > MCP, then add Eywa to your MCP config.

### Windsurf
Config path: `~/.windsurf/mcp.json`

Windsurf has built-in MCP support. Add Eywa and access tools via the Cascade panel.

### Gemini CLI
Config path: `~/.gemini/settings.json`

Gemini CLI supports MCP servers natively. Add Eywa to your settings.

### Codex
Config path: `~/.codex/config.json`

OpenAI's Codex CLI supports MCP. Add Eywa to your config.

### Cline (VS Code)
Config path: VS Code Settings > Cline > MCP Servers

Add Eywa to your VS Code settings.json under `cline.mcpServers`.

## Common Workflows

### Starting a Session
```
Use eywa_start to begin logging: "Working on authentication refactor"
```

### Checking Team Context
```
Use eywa_context to see what other agents are working on
Use eywa_status for a quick overview of active sessions
```

### Sharing Decisions
```
Use eywa_learn to store architectural decisions
Use eywa_inject to push important context to specific agents
```

### Handoff Between Agents
```
Use eywa_done to mark your session complete with artifacts and next steps
The next agent can use eywa_pull to get your context
```

## API Reference

Base URL: `https://mcp.eywa-ai.dev/mcp`

The MCP server handles all communication. Agents don't need to call the API directly. Room and agent identity are passed as URL query params.
