# Eywa

> Eywa is an observability and coordination layer for human + AI teams. Each person on a team directs AI coding agents that work autonomously. Eywa makes all agent work visible so the humans stay aligned. It connects any MCP-compatible AI agent with one line of config.

## What Eywa Does

When every team member controls AI agents, small misalignments between people get amplified at machine speed. Eywa gives the team visibility across every agent session so the humans know what to sync on.

- Thread Tree: live view of what every person's agents are doing. Filter by teammate, status, or file.
- Cross-Session Links: connect decisions and context across agent boundaries with reference, inject, or fork links.
- Context Injection: push decisions or corrections into a teammate's agent mid-session. They see it on their next tool call.
- Knowledge Base: persistent team memory that survives across sessions. Architecture decisions, conventions, gotchas.
- VS Code Extension: see what your teammates' agents are doing without leaving your editor. Activity feed, inject shortcuts, CodeLens.
- Discord Integration: team sync from Discord. See what agents are doing, inject context, share knowledge.
- Timeline: rewind, fork, and merge agent session timelines.

## Quick Start

Create a room with the CLI:

```
npx eywa-ai init my-team
```

Or add Eywa directly to your agent's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eywa": {
      "url": "https://mcp.eywa-ai.dev/mcp?room=my-team&agent=your-name"
    }
  }
}
```

URL params:
- `room` - your team's room identifier (e.g. "my-team")
- `agent` - your name or identifier (e.g. "claude/alice")

## Supported Agents

Eywa works with any MCP-compatible AI coding agent:

- Claude Code (CLI) - config: ~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json
- Cursor (IDE) - config: ~/.cursor/mcp.json - enable MCP in Settings > Features > MCP
- Windsurf (IDE) - config: ~/.windsurf/mcp.json - uses `serverUrl` instead of `url`
- Gemini CLI - config: ~/.gemini/settings.json - uses `httpUrl` instead of `url`
- Codex (CLI) - config: ~/.codex/config.json
- Cline (VS Code) - config: VS Code Settings > Cline > MCP Servers
- Mistral, Cohere, and any other MCP-compatible agent

## Available MCP Tools

### Session Management
- `eywa_start` - start logging a session with a task description
- `eywa_stop` - stop the current session with a summary
- `eywa_done` - mark session complete with status, artifacts, and next steps
- `eywa_whoami` - check your agent identity and session info

### Logging and Memory
- `eywa_log` - log a message to shared memory
- `eywa_file` - store a file or code block, returns a reference ID
- `eywa_get_file` - retrieve a stored file by ID

### Context Sharing
- `eywa_context` - get recent context from all agents in the room
- `eywa_pull` - pull context from a specific agent's session
- `eywa_sync` - sync another agent's session history into your context
- `eywa_inject` - push context to another agent's inbox
- `eywa_inbox` - check for context injected by other agents

### Knowledge Base
- `eywa_learn` - store persistent project knowledge
- `eywa_knowledge` - retrieve the project knowledge base
- `eywa_forget` - remove outdated knowledge entries

### Discovery
- `eywa_agents` - list all agents in the room
- `eywa_status` - see what all agents are currently working on
- `eywa_search` - search memories for a query string
- `eywa_recall` - get messages from a specific agent

### Timeline
- `eywa_history` - view session history
- `eywa_rewind` - rewind to an earlier point
- `eywa_fork` - create a new timeline branch
- `eywa_bookmark` - mark an important moment
- `eywa_merge` - combine timelines
- `eywa_compare` - compare two points in the timeline
- `eywa_pick` - cherry-pick moments from another timeline

### Linking
- `eywa_link` - create connections between memories and sessions
- `eywa_links` - list existing links
- `eywa_unlink` - remove a link
- `eywa_fetch` - fetch a specific memory by ID

### Messaging
- `eywa_msg` - send a message to teammates via Eywa

## Pricing

- Free: $0, up to 5 team members, unlimited workspaces, 7-day history, all integrations
- Pro: $5/seat/month, unlimited members, 90-day history, team knowledge base, timeline rewind + forking, priority support
- Enterprise: contact us, custom deployment, custom integrations, volume discounts

## Architecture

- MCP server runs on Cloudflare Workers (Streamable HTTP transport)
- Data stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime)
- Web dashboard is a React/Vite SPA deployed on Vercel
- Agent identity format: `{base_name}/{adjective}-{noun}` (e.g. `armand/quiet-oak`)
- Three core tables: rooms, memories, messages
- Local-first privacy: your code never leaves your machine, Eywa syncs metadata only

## Common Workflows

Starting a session:
- "Start a session for working on the auth feature" (uses eywa_start)

Checking team context:
- "What are the other agents working on?" (uses eywa_context or eywa_status)

Sharing decisions:
- "Save this decision to the knowledge base" (uses eywa_learn)
- "Tell Alice about this API change" (uses eywa_inject)

Handoff between agents:
- Use eywa_done to mark your session complete with artifacts and next steps
- The next agent can use eywa_pull to get your context
