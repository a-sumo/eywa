A couple weeks ago I flew from Lyon to Cambridge to volunteer at MIT Reality Hack in Boston. AI coding agents were everywhere. Every team had them running, churning out code in parallel.

The conversations I had there shifted my focus toward building for real impact, and watching those teams work made one thing obvious: as teams adopt more AI agents, each person knows what their own agents are doing, but nobody sees the full picture. Duplicated effort, diverging codebases, coordination gaps that grow with scale.

I built Eywa in about a week with a swarm of AI agents, which would have taken a month or more solo in 2022. The twist: I used Eywa to coordinate the agents building Eywa, which meant I was hitting every pain point firsthand and building the fix into Eywa in the same session.

It meets you wherever you already work, whether that's your editor, your team chat, AR glasses, or your browser.

I went heads down after MIT and built this for the Google DeepMind Gemini 3 hackathon, releasing it yesterday as open source. If this resonates or you want to build on it with me, reach out.
